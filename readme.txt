Features:
When playing the game, you are put in a tank in an arena-like area in which you face waves of enemy tanks and turrets who will try to destroy you.

To your advantage however, are three types of power ups that can be found in the arena:
1. Health Powerup - Restores an amount of health
2. Shield Powerup - Grants invulnerability for a length of time
3. Ammo Powerup - Grants infinite ammo for a length of time

Health is shown in the bottom right of the screen, and ammo in the bottom left.

To progress in the game, defeat all of the enemies in each wave until you are bested. Try to beat your last score!
